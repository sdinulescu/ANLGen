# ANLGen
A set of examples and references, implementing several common analog filters for audio programming using Max MSP. Built using Gen, ANLGen filters and waveshapers are conveniently contained in Gen objects, able to be easily used (and manipulated) in your Max patches. 

## Filter Types
- Moog (implemented Oct 28 2020, added Nov 5 2020)
- Butterworth (implemented Nov 5 2020)
- Biquad (implemented Nov 15 2020)
- Comb: feedforward and feedback (implemented Nov 19 2020)

## Potential Filters To Implement
- Elliptic (Cauer)
- Bessel
- Gaussian
- Optimum "L" (Legendre) filter
- Linkwitz-Riley
- Lattice

## Waveshaping
- Chebyshev polynomials: type I and type II -- inverse (implemented on Nov 8 2020)
